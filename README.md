# Reactive Form App

This my first application written in Angular framework. As it is my first experience with Angular (not mentioning Reactive Forms), I know there are still some things to fix/refactor, but I tried my best.

Change made 15.12.2021 -> 08:14 15.12.2021  -  There was a wrong display, I realized it showed total premium amount instead of installment amount.
